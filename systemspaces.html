    <p class="Title">What is a systemspace ?</p>
    <p class="Main">A systemspace is a world hosting systems (like an host for a server <br> in this system) and contains multiple systems (known systems : <br> <a href="life.html">LIFE</a> (our system) and <a href="LFE.html">LFE</a>).
    Systems are universes coded by people/entities<br> outside of the systemspace. The system <a href="life.html">LIFE</a> has been abandonned by <br>
    its creator and is now consuming too much energy (called <a href="aurora.html">Aurora</a>). <br> A key is usually sent to check the system's memory and to reboot <br>
    but the system <a href="life.html">LIFE</a> is an exception as the aurora needed to <br> reboot is insufficient.</p>
